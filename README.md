##UI-DV

####What is it?
UI-DV is an angular data visualization library. It has pre-set directives that are extensive and configurable for easy injection into your app.

####Installation & Setup
Run ````npm install ui-dv```` and inject "ui-dv" as a dependency into your angular app. Don't forget to include the script tag for ui.dv.js in your html.

####Documentation
Every directive has the following basic attributes: data, fcn, and options.  
Data is an array - the elements can be simply numbers, or they can be objects with number and string properties.  
```data = [1,2,3,4] || [{name: 'one', value: 1}, {name: 'two', value: 2}]```  
It does not matter what you call the keys for the objects, but one value has to be a string and the other a number. The strings will be used as labels on the graph.  
Fcn is a function - this function will be wired as an ng-click for each data element. It will receive the element itself as well as its index in the array.  
Options is an object - the available options slightly vary depending on the directive. Refer to the table below for details.


Example directive:  
```$scope.data = [1,2,3,4]; 

$scope.running = function() {  

	console.log('running');  

}  

$scope.options = {sideways: true};  

<bar-graph data="data" fcn="running" options="options"></bar-graph>```

Include script tag with link to file in html. Angular must also be included.
